                    Developed 5+ e-commerce sites for small business owners using various web technologies
                    I meet with clients to hear what they expect the site to appear and how they'd like the pages to link to each other and maintain contact during the design process. I carefully test sites to ascertain they function smoothly on computers and smartphones and with different browsers and have participated in developing apps.
